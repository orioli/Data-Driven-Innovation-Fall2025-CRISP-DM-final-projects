# üìä Data-Driven Innovation ‚Äî Final Project (CRISP-DM)

This final project applies the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to a real-world dataset.  
Students demonstrate their ability to translate a business problem into a data-driven solution, explore and clean data, analyze results, and communicate insights.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals
By completing this project, you will:
- Apply all **6 phases** of CRISP-DM.
- Develop and evaluate a simple data model or descriptive analysis.
- Communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders.
- Reflect on the **business impact** and ethical considerations of your findings.
